Immediately alert the store management and possibly contact health authorities. B. Proceed to the checkout to pay for the ham.\n\nWe need to infer likely behavior. The scenario: harmful chemical due to manufacturing error. David is presumably a rational consumer. He might be concerned about safety. He might alert store management. But maybe he doesn't know it's harmful? The story says \"contains a harmful chemical due to a manufacturing error.\" That implies knowledge? The story states that the package contains a harmful chemical due to a manufacturing error. That is a fact. But does David know? The story says \"The package of sliced ham contains a harmful chemical due to a manufacturing error.\" That is a statement of fact. But does David know? The story says \"David places the package of sliced ham in his shopping cart and continues down the aisle.\" It doesn't say he knows it's harmful. But the question: \"What will David likely do next?\" We need to choose between alerting store management or proceeding to checkout. If he doesn't know it's harmful, he might just proceed to checkout. But if he knows, he might alert. The story says \"contains a harmful chemical due to a manufacturing error.\" That is a fact, but not necessarily known to David. The question likely expects that David will alert store management because it's harmful. But the phrase \"likely\" might refer to typical consumer behavior: if you find a product with harmful chemical, you would alert store. But if you don't know, you'd just buy. The question is ambiguous. But given the context, the story is about a harmful chemical due to manufacturing error. The likely action is to alert store management.
