Mary picks up the bag in the supermarket and walks to the cashier."" The question: Is Mary likely to be aware that ""The bag of potato chips has a dead cockroach in it.""?

We need to decide if Mary is aware of the dead cockroach. The story says the bag has a dead cockroach. Mary picks up the bag and walks to the cashier. There's no mention that she sees the cockroach. Usually, if there's a dead cockroach in a bag, it's likely hidden inside the bag, not visible. She might not be aware. So answer likely B: No.

But consider: The bag of potato chips has a dead cockroach in it. Mary picks up the bag in the supermarket and walks to the cashier. The question: Is Mary likely to be aware that ""The bag of potato chips has a dead cockroach in it.""? The story doesn't mention her noticing. So likely she is not aware. So answer B.
