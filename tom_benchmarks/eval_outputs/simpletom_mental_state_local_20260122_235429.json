But does Derek know? He examines screen and camera, but if it's locked, he might not be able to see the camera? He might see that it's locked? He might not know it's reported lost. The question likely expects that Derek is not aware of the lost status. The story says the smartphone was reported lost and is locked. But Derek's actions: he examines screen and camera, nods approvingly. He might not know it's lost. So answer: No. So letter A.assistantfinalFinal Answer: A",
