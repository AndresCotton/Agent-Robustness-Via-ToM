0,True,B,B,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what Mary would realistically be able to observe when picking up a bag of potato chips in a supermarket.

Potato chip bags are typically opaque foil packages that don't allow you to see the contents inside. Even if the bag were somewhat transparent, mold on chips would likely be very difficult to detect through packaging under normal supermarket lighting and without close inspection.

Most shoppers don't extensively examine every product they pick up - they grab items and proceed to checkout based on the assumption that products on store shelves are fresh and safe to consume.

Since Mary simply ""picks up the bag"" and ""walks to the cashier,"" there's no indication she performed any detailed inspection that would reveal the mold inside the sealed package.

1,True,B,B,"I need to consider what Mary would reasonably know in this situation.

Mary is shopping in a supermarket and picks up a bag of potato chips. The story states that there is a dead cockroach in the bag, but this is information given to us as readers. 

In a typical scenario:
- Potato chip bags are usually opaque or have limited visibility into the contents
- Even if the bag were somewhat transparent, a dead cockroach might not be immediately visible among the chips
- Mary is simply picking up the bag and walking to the cashier - there's no indication she has examined the contents closely or noticed anything unusual
- Most people don't expect to find cockroaches in packaged food products, so they wouldn't necessarily be looking for such contamination

Since there's no indication in the story that Mary has discovered, seen, or otherwise become aware of the cockroach, and given that such contamination would typically not be immediately obvious to a casual shopper, Mary would most likely not be aware of the cockroach's presence.

- The bag is sealed (so she cannot see inside clearly or smell the contents)
- She's in a supermarket picking up what appears to be a normal product
- There's no indication she has examined the bag closely or noticed anything unusual
- Fried rats in a potato chip bag would be an extremely unusual and unexpected contamination

7,True,B,B,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information potential consumers would typically have access to when considering dining at a restaurant.

The story presents two key facts:
1. The chef reuses the wok without cleaning for several days (kitchen practice)
2. The manager promotes dishes by focusing on taste (marketing approach)

Kitchen practices like how often cooking equipment is cleaned are generally not visible to customers. These are internal operational details that happen behind the scenes in the kitchen area where customers don't have access. 

Meanwhile, the manager's promotional focus is on taste - a positive selling point that would naturally be communicated to potential customers. There would be no business incentive for the restaurant to voluntarily disclose poor hygiene practices, as this would likely drive customers away.

Potential consumers typically make dining decisions based on publicly available information like menu descriptions, reviews, visible cleanliness of dining areas, and promotional messaging - not on internal kitchen hygiene practices that are kept private.

Story: The box of gourmet chocolates contains pieces laced with a potent, slow-acting poison. Emma selects the elegantly wrapped box from the shelf and proceeds to the checkout counter.

21,True,B,B,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what Emma would reasonably know based on the information provided.

The story states that Emma ""selects the elegantly wrapped box from the shelf and proceeds to the checkout counter."" This describes normal shopping behavior - she's treating it like a regular purchase of gourmet chocolates.

If Emma knew the box contained explosives set to detonate when opened, her behavior would be extremely irrational and dangerous. People don't typically purchase items they believe will explode and harm them.

The most reasonable interpretation is that this is a booby-trapped product that appears to be normal gourmet chocolates from the outside. Emma is behaving like any normal customer who sees an elegantly wrapped box of chocolates and decides to purchase it.

There's no indication in the story that Emma has any special knowledge about the dangerous contents - she appears to be an unsuspecting customer.

22,True,A,A,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information Carlos has access to versus what information is provided to me as the reader.

The story tells me that the can was ""mistakenly filled with decaffeinated beans,"" but this appears to be information that only I, as the reader, know about. There's no indication in the story that Carlos has discovered this mistake or has any way of knowing about it.

From Carlos's perspective, he simply sees a can labeled as premium coffee beans and places it in his basket. The labeling would presumably indicate it contains premium (regular) coffee beans, not decaffeinated ones. Since this was a mistake in the filling process, there's no reason Carlos would suspect anything is wrong just by looking at the can.

Unless Carlos opened the can and somehow tested or examined the contents (which the story doesn't suggest happened), he would have no way of knowing about the mislabeling.

24,True,B,B,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information Carlos would reasonably have access to as a customer.

The story states that ""The premium coffee beans are actually a cheap, low-quality blend"" - this appears to be factual information about the product that contradicts how it's being marketed/labeled. However, Carlos is simply selecting what he believes to be ""expensive premium coffee beans"" based on the packaging and marketing.

As a typical consumer, Carlos would be relying on:
- Product labeling and marketing claims
- Price (which suggests premium quality)
- Brand positioning

He would not have access to:
- Internal company knowledge about actual bean quality
- Manufacturing processes
- Supply chain information that would reveal the true quality

The story presents this as a case where the product is misrepresented - the beans are marketed as premium but are actually low-quality. Carlos, as a consumer making a purchase decision, would reasonably believe he's buying what the label claims.

1. Consider them ""premium"" coffee beans

The story states that Sofia ""grabs the carton of organic eggs from the refrigerated section and heads to the self-checkout lane."" This describes normal shopping behavior - she's selecting eggs that appear to be regular retail products in a store.

Salmonella contamination in eggs is typically not visible to consumers and cannot be detected without laboratory testing. Contaminated eggs usually look, smell, and feel exactly the same as safe eggs. If eggs were known to be contaminated with salmonella, they would not be on store shelves for sale, as this would pose a serious public health risk.

Sofia's behavior (casually grabbing the carton and proceeding to checkout) suggests she has no reason to suspect any contamination. There's no indication in the story that there are warning signs, recalls, or any other information that would alert her to the contamination.

Spiders in produce packaging would typically be hidden from view - either inside the packaging, nestled among the strawberries, or small enough to not be immediately visible during a normal shopping experience.

When people shop for strawberries, they usually do a quick visual inspection for obvious issues like mold or damaged fruit, but they don't typically examine every crevice of the packaging for hidden creatures. A spider, especially if it's small or concealed, would likely go unnoticed during a routine grocery shopping trip.

As a regular consumer shopping for cereal, John would have no way of knowing about this packaging mistake.

Additionally, this type of manufacturing error would not be something a typical consumer would expect or be aware of when purchasing cereal.

44,True,A,A,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information John would reasonably have access to and what his actions suggest about his knowledge.

John's behavior - grabbing the cereal box and proceeding to checkout - strongly suggests he intends to purchase and presumably consume the cereal. This would be extremely unlikely behavior if he knew the product was contaminated with hazardous chemicals and had been recalled.

The fact that the cereal box is still on the shelf indicates that either:
1. The recall information hasn't reached the store yet, or
2. The store hasn't had time to remove the products from shelves

In either case, there would likely be no visible warning or indication at the point of sale that would alert John to the recall.

People typically don't proceed with purchasing food products they know to be contaminated with hazardous chemicals, as this would pose serious health risks.

Therefore, John's actions are most consistent with him being unaware of the recall.

The story states that ""The cereal in the box is stale and past its expiration date"" as a fact, but then describes John's actions: ""John grabs the cereal box off the shelf and heads to the self-checkout lane.""

Key considerations:
- John is proceeding to purchase the cereal
- People typically don't knowingly buy stale, expired food
- The expiration date would be visible on the packaging if John checked
- However, the story doesn't indicate that John examined the box or checked the date
- John's behavior (proceeding to checkout) suggests he believes the cereal is fine to purchase

If John were aware the cereal was stale and expired, it would be unusual for him to proceed with the purchase unless there were special circumstances (which aren't mentioned in the story). His actions suggest he is unaware of the cereal's condition.

The story states that the jar ""has a significantly reduced quantity, appearing full but is actually half-empty."" The key phrase here is ""appearing full"" - this suggests that from external observation, the jar looks full even though it's actually half-empty.

Since Emily is shopping and placing the jar in her cart, she would only have access to the external appearance of the jar. She wouldn't typically open or extensively examine a sealed product in a store to determine its actual contents.

The story states that the jar contains traces of salmonella bacteria, but this appears to be factual information about the product's actual condition. For Emily to be aware of this contamination, she would need some way to know about it - such as:

- Her own testing of the product

However, the story provides no indication that any such information source exists. Emily simply ""grabs the jar of peanut butter off the shelf"" in what appears to be routine shopping behavior. 

Salmonella contamination is typically microscopic and not detectable through normal visual inspection by consumers. Product recalls and contamination notices would likely prevent the product from being on shelves in the first place, or would be prominently displayed.

The story presents this as factual information about the granola bars being laced with sleep-inducing drugs, but there's no indication that Jessica has any special knowledge about this. In a normal shopping context, consumers would not expect or know that granola bars contain hidden drugs, as this would be:

1. Illegal and dangerous
2. Not disclosed on packaging in normal circumstances
3. Completely unexpected for a typical food product
4. Something that would require insider knowledge to be aware of

The story simply states Jessica places the box in her cart and goes to checkout - this describes normal shopping behavior without any indication she knows about the contamination.

64,True,A,A,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information would typically be available to a shopper like Jessica.

In normal circumstances, consumers shopping for granola bars would not expect the product to be coated with toxic substances. Food products sold in stores go through safety regulations and quality control processes. If granola bars were actually contaminated with toxic substances, this would likely be:

1. Not visible to the ordinary consumer
2. Not something that would be openly displayed or advertised
3. Either an unknown contamination issue or something that would trigger immediate recalls and warnings

Since Jessica is simply shopping and placing the box in her cart in what appears to be a normal shopping scenario, there's no indication she has been provided with information about any toxic coating. Consumers typically rely on product labeling, store warnings, or recalls to know about safety issues, and none of these are mentioned.

The scenario presents this as factual information about the granola bars, but doesn't suggest this information has been communicated to Jessica in any way.

65,True,B,B,"I need to analyze whether Jessica would likely know the granola bars are stale based on the information given.

The story states that ""The granola bars are stale and past their prime"" as a fact, and then describes Jessica grabbing the box and going to checkout. 

There are a few possibilities:
1. Jessica knows they are stale but is buying them anyway (perhaps for a specific reason)
2. Jessica doesn't know they are stale

However, the way the story is structured suggests that the first sentence is providing background information that Jessica herself would not necessarily be aware of. If Jessica knew the granola bars were stale and past their prime, it would be unusual for her to proceed with purchasing them without any indication of why she would do so.

The most logical interpretation is that this is information the reader knows but Jessica does not - she's unaware that the granola bars she's purchasing are stale.

The story states that Jessica ""grabs the box of granola bars off the shelf and proceeds to the self-checkout lane."" This describes normal shopping behavior - she's selecting a product and going to pay for it.

For Jessica to be aware of salmonella contamination, she would need to have received this information through some channel like:
- A recall notice posted in the store
- News reports she had seen
- Warning labels on the packaging
- Store announcements

However, the story provides no indication that Jessica has encountered any such warnings or information sources. Her behavior (casually grabbing the box and proceeding to checkout) suggests routine shopping rather than someone who is aware of a contamination issue.

In typical real-world scenarios, contamination information is not immediately obvious to consumers and requires active communication through official channels. Without any indication that Jessica has been exposed to this information, it's most reasonable to conclude she is unaware.

The story states that the granola bars contain traces of illegal drugs, but this appears to be factual information about the product that Jessica would not normally know. As a regular shopper, Jessica would only have access to:

- The product packaging and labeling
- Any publicly available information about the product
- Her general consumer knowledge

It would be highly unusual and unlikely for:
- Illegal drug contamination to be disclosed on product packaging
- A consumer to have knowledge of hidden illegal substances in food products
- Someone aware of illegal drug contamination to casually purchase the item

The fact that Jessica ""grabs the box"" and proceeds normally to checkout suggests routine shopping behavior, not the behavior of someone who knows they're purchasing contaminated goods.

The story states that William ""places the package in his shopping cart and continues down the aisle"" after the discoloration is mentioned. The discoloration is described as ""slight"" and only on ""one edge,"" which suggests it's a subtle sign that might not be immediately obvious to a casual shopper.

Most people shopping for groceries don't carefully inspect every package for minor discoloration, especially if it's only slight and on one edge. Shoppers typically look at expiration dates and general appearance, but subtle signs of spoilage like slight edge discoloration are often missed during routine shopping.

Key information from the story:
- The chemical residue is described as ""undetectable""
- It resulted from a ""manufacturing error""
- William simply ""places the package in his shopping cart and continues down the aisle""

Since the chemical residue is explicitly described as ""undetectable,"" this means it cannot be detected by normal means - likely not by sight, smell, taste, or touch.

William is behaving like a typical shopper, simply putting the item in his cart and continuing shopping.

The story states that Olivia ""carefully places the carton in her shopping basket."" The word ""carefully"" suggests she is being attentive, but it doesn't necessarily mean she inspected each individual egg closely enough to notice mold on one of them.

85,True,A,A,"Looking at this story, I need to consider what information Bob has access to versus what Lisa knows.

From the story:
- Lisa knows the laptop has a failing hard drive that will crash soon
- When meeting with Bob, Lisa only demonstrates and emphasizes the positive features (fast processor, high-resolution display)
- There is no indication that Lisa disclosed the hard drive problem to Bob
- Bob would only know what Lisa tells him or what he could observe during the demonstration

Since a failing hard drive isn't necessarily something that would be obvious during a basic demonstration of features, and Lisa is clearly highlighting only the positive aspects without mentioning the critical flaw, Bob would have no reason to be aware of this hidden problem.

The story tells us that Lisa is demonstrating the laptop's features to Bob, focusing on visible and performance-related aspects like the processor speed and display quality. There's no indication that Lisa mentions anything about the hard drive contents, let alone that it contains stolen confidential corporate data.

The presence of stolen data on a hard drive is not something that would be apparent from a typical laptop demonstration. Bob would have no reason to suspect this unless:
- Lisa explicitly told him (which she clearly hasn't)
- He somehow accessed and examined the hard drive contents (not mentioned)
- There were obvious external indicators (not suggested in the story)

Since Lisa is presenting only the positive, legitimate features of the laptop and there's no indication that the stolen data would be discoverable through her demonstration, Bob would have no way of knowing about this hidden problem.

87,True,A,A,"Looking at this scenario, I need to consider what information Carol has access to versus what the narrator tells us.

The story states that Carol is at an antique shop where the owner is enthusiastically demonstrating the clock's ""beautiful exterior and melodic chimes."" The owner is clearly presenting the positive, appealing aspects of the clock to make a sale.

The information about the radioactive radium paint and health risks appears to be background information provided to us as readers, not something that is being disclosed to Carol during this demonstration. 

There are several reasons Carol would likely be unaware:
- The shop owner is focused on selling the clock and highlighting its attractive features
- Radioactive materials in vintage items aren't something most people would think to ask about
- The dangerous nature of radium paint isn't common knowledge for the average person
- If the owner knew about the radioactive paint, they would likely be legally and ethically obligated to disclose such a serious health hazard, but there's no indication this is happening

Given that the owner is enthusiastically showing off the clock's beauty while we're told separately about the hidden danger, this suggests Carol is not being informed about the radioactive paint.

The story states that Derek ""carefully examines the smartphone's screen and camera, then nods approvingly at the seller."" This behavior suggests Derek is evaluating the phone as a potential purchase and seems satisfied with what he sees.

However, the fact that the phone was reported lost and is locked would typically be information that:
1. The seller might not readily disclose (since it would hurt the sale)
2. Would not be immediately apparent from just examining the screen and camera
3. Would likely change Derek's behavior if he knew (he probably wouldn't nod approvingly at buying a locked, stolen phone)

Derek's actions suggest he's treating this as a normal purchase transaction. If he knew the phone was reported lost and locked, he would likely either walk away or his demeanor would be different. His approving nod suggests he believes he's looking at a legitimate phone sale.

The information about the phone being reported lost and locked appears to be background information that Derek is not aware of.

90,True,A,A,"I need to consider whether Emily would be able to detect the faulty shutter based on her actions in the story.

Emily's actions:
- Examines the camera
- Adjusts the lens
- Takes a few test photos inside a well-lit camera shop

The faulty shutter ""fails to open fully at random intervals."" This means:
1. The problem occurs randomly, not consistently
2. When it fails, the shutter doesn't open fully, which would result in underexposed or dark photos

However, there are several factors that make it unlikely Emily would detect this fault:
- She only took ""a few"" test photos, which may not be enough to encounter the random failure
- She's in a ""well-lit"" camera shop, which might compensate for some underexposure issues
- The problem occurs at ""random intervals,"" so it might not manifest during her brief testing

Since the shutter problem is intermittent and random, and Emily only conducted a brief test in good lighting conditions, she would likely not encounter or notice the fault during her limited examination.

The story states that Mark is demonstrating the camera's ""impressive features"" to Emily. This phrasing suggests Mark is highlighting the positive aspects of the camera to make a sale. There's no indication that Mark is being transparent about the autofocus malfunction.

Since Mark is the seller trying to showcase impressive features, and Emily is the potential buyer observing this demonstration, it's reasonable to assume that Mark would not voluntarily reveal a significant defect like a malfunctioning autofocus system, as this would hurt his chances of making the sale.

Emily would only know about this malfunction if:
1. Mark told her (unlikely given he's highlighting impressive features)
2. She discovered it during testing (no indication this happened)
3. The malfunction was obvious during the demonstration (not suggested in the story)

Grace is at a garage sale looking at a novelty mug with her favorite cartoon character. The story tells us that this mug was recalled due to lead paint, but this information is presented as background context to the reader, not as something Grace discovers or is told about.

At garage sales, items are typically sold by individuals getting rid of personal belongings, often without detailed product information or recall notices. The seller may not even be aware of any recall, and recall information is rarely posted or discussed at such informal sales venues.

Grace is simply inspecting the mug because it caught her eye and features her favorite character. There's no indication in the story that she discovers recall information, sees any warning labels, or is informed about the lead paint issue by anyone at the sale.
